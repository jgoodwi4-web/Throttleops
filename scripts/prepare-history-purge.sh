Usage: $(basename "$0") [--paths path1,path2] [--execute] [--force-push]

Options:
  --paths   Comma-separated list of paths to remove from history (default: config/.env)
  --execute Actually run git-filter-repo in the mirror clone (otherwise this script only prepares the mirror and prints commands)
  --force-push  After running git-filter-repo, also force-push the rewritten refs to origin (REQUIRES interactive confirmation)

Examples:
  # Prepare a mirror and show commands (safe)
  ./scripts/prepare-history-purge.sh

  # Prepare and run filter locally in the mirror (but do NOT push)
  ./scripts/prepare-history-purge.sh --paths config/.env,web/.env --execute

  # WARNING: Run and force-push (only after explicit coordination)
  ./scripts/prepare-history-purge.sh --execute --force-push

Dry-run summary
----------------
Mirror clone location: $MIRROR_DIR/repo.git
To run the filter in the mirror (this will rewrite history in the mirror only):

  cd $MIRROR_DIR/repo.git
  $FILTER_CMD

After running the filter you should inspect the mirror repository carefully. If you are satisfied, the force-push commands are:

  # WARNING: This will rewrite the remote history for all refs. Coordinate with collaborators.
  cd $MIRROR_DIR/repo.git
  git push --force --all origin
  git push --force --tags origin
